# Will_It_Rain

Will it rain tomorrow in Australia? 

My group mates (Francesco Santucciu,Mario Bianchi, Michele Andreucci) and I tried to answer this question by analysing a dataset containing Australian daily weather observations. 

The project is realised through the use of PySpark, an interface for Apache Spark in Python.

The study consists of: an unsupervised study using clustering, in order to group weather observations with common characteristics;  use of machine learning algorithms for a binary classification task and a regression task.
